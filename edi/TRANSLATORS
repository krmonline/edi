TRANSLATION GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPERS

1.) Create the English language files first.
2.) Make sure that your program is completed and will not require any translating after 
    you have contacted the translators! They will not translate a few words at a time but only the
    completed program!
3.) There should be a working copy of the program available for the translators so they can
    see what they are translating.
4.) Do not contact the persons below for anything else.
5.) If you want to be on this list or you want to be removed from this list please send an edited
    copy of this file to: <mschering@intermesh.nl>

Hi translators,

A new version of Group-Office is released and it requires addtional translation. Please donwload the new version and send me the translations.
The new strings are at the bottom and are under the line '//translation required'. Please cross-check the files with your copy in your language and add the new strings to the language files in YOUR language.
Please send the complete language pack in YOUR language to "mschering@intermesh.nl". I don't want the english files with other languages inside them because that's very inefficiënt and can cause mistakes.
You can find a working copy at group-office.sourceforge.net: user:translator passwd: trans. This user has access to the e-mail app. You can also get the latest version from the CVS server. See http://group-office.sourceforge.net for instructions to access the CVS server.

Good luck and thank you very much!

Merijn Schering
