If you already installed the first 2.03 then delete all files except for
Group-Office.php and replace all other by the files from this package.

Now open lib/updates.inc and check all the SQL updates for 2.02 and see
if your database matches. Look for the ab_custom_... tables and 
bm_bookmarks tables esspecially.
