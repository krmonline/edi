2003/04/26 version 1.02

FRAMEWORK:
- Fixed bug in install script that created illegal file and directory 
  create modes
- changed default file storage path to '/home/groupoffice/<username>'
  instead of '/usr/groupoffice/<username>'
- Make the module configuration more user friendly by listing the folders in
  the modules folder.
- Language autodetects when not set
- At system information you can view PHP information
- I declare the framework stable (including contact manager)
- Added FAQ file

FILESYSTEM MODULE:
- Search for files and folders added filesystem
- Security bug solved
- Sharing bug solved
- It's now possible to set permissions for files too.
- Some small bug fixes

SCHEDULER MODULE:
- There are small changes in the database structure. some columns were removed.
- Removed the location scheduler function and instead of that
  I added the feature to add an event to multiple schedulers at once.
- Invited users can unsubscribe events 
  (delete events from thier schedulers without really deleting the event).
- Added buttons for day and week view.
- List all events for a scheduler in a table.

E-MAIL MODULE:
- Removed '/novalidate-cert' option from connect function. This option is
  needed with some Redhat distro's because of a bug in 
  the redhat php-imap package. If you have a redhat server add: '/notls' 
  after the host part in Group-Office.
- Fixed bug:when adding or modifying an account it was impossible to navigate 
  to the mailboxes.

PROJECTS MODULE:
- Nothing done this is quite useless unless you are dutch speaking.
