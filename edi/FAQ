GROUP-OFFICE FAQ

1. Why don't I see any modules like, email filesystem or scheduler?	
	You have to log in as an administrator and add them manually in the menu: administrator->modules
	Then select the modules you wish to use.
	
2. Can I upload big files?
	Yes you can. But some changes to php.ini are required for this:
	
	post_max_size = ??M
	file_uploads = On
	upload_max_filesize = ??M
	
	for apache's module config: conf.d/php.conf:
	
	limit_request_body = ?? 
	
	Also if the upload is taking a long time you should set the connection timeout from your webserver 
	to a higher value. For apache (httpd.conf):
	
	Timeout ???
	
	Also check for Proxy server limits
	
	
3. Why can't I connect to IMAP or POP-3 servers?
	With some distro's (Redhat) you should add: '/notls' after the local_email_host property
	in Group-Office.php for local e-mail. For external mail servers you should put it behind
	the hostname part when you add an account.

4. Can I create folders and filters with POP-3 servers?
	No you can't. Multiple folders and filters are only supported with IMAP servers.

6. How can I browse the Group-Office files with samba or ftp?
	Load install.php in a browser and change the create mode to '0777' if you understand what you are doing.
	 
7. Why do I get this error when i use the e-mail module?
   'Error: the imap extension for PHP is not installed' or 
   'Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imap_utf7_encode() in ../classes/imap.class.inc on line 33'
   	
   	You didn't compile imap in PHP this is required for both IMAP and POP3.

8. Why do I instantly get an access denied error when I open the file manager?
	Becasue the home directories from the users are not writable for the webserver. The home directories are located
	in the path you entered where Group-Office should store files. The default setting is /home/groupoffice.
	The directory groupoffice should be owned by the webserver user and the directory home should be 
	accessible (executable).

9. I have set up Group-Office to create Samba users. But how can I set up the samba shares?
	
	Set up a share like below and each user will have access to it's private files. NOte that the Group-Office
	permissions don't work with Samba. 
	BEWARE OF THE 777 FILE PERMISSIONS! They are needed so the webserver can read and write to them as well.
	
	[groupoffice]
	   comment = Group-Office Home directory
	   writable = yes
	   valid users = %U
	   path = /usr/groupoffice/%U
	   force create mode = 0777
	   directory mode = 0777

10. After installation I can't change the ownership of Group-Office.php and it won't start. What can I do?
	You can donwload Group-Office.php with FTP, delete it from the server and upload it back.
	
11. Why do I have to logon twice?
	Logon to the same domain you entered in Group-Office.php
	If you set the host in Group-Office.php to eg. 123.123.123.123 and you type www.example.com in the browser
	you will have to logon twice. This is because after the first login the server creates a session for ip 123.123.123.123. 
	Group-Office redirects you to the startpage with url http://www.example.com/. There's no valid session for this url yet.
	
12. Why can' t I connect to Cyrus? It gives me a cross-realm error.
	Try these settings:
		allowplaintext:yes;
		sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
		sasl_minimum_layer:0

13. I've put my config file in /etc/Group-Office/../.... But when I access Group-Office
	with different URL's it sometimes doesn't find the config file.
	
	You need to set: "UseCanonicalName On" in httpd.conf of apache. This way
	it always uses the same name.
